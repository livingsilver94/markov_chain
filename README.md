# markov_chain
A Markov Chain library I made for fun.

It doesn't have a specific goal or task to accomplish, it's something I wanted to write to improve my skills in Rust
and to use various software engineering techniques likes proper tests and struct/enum subdivision.
I tried to make this library as efficient as possible, both in execution speed and memory footprint, but I don't guarantee
it's _optimized_ at all.

Contributions are well accepted!
